# Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is a mini web app that lets users browse and search movies using **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the app displays movie posters, titles, ratings, and short overviews in a responsive card layout. Users can explore popular movies or search for any movie by name, making it a simple, interactive, and visually appealing portfolio project. The app is fully deployable on **GitHub Pages**.
